# NORA Registry Protocol Compatibility

This document describes which parts of each registry protocol are implemented in NORA.

**Legend:** Full = complete implementation, Partial = basic support with limitations, Stub = placeholder, — = not implemented

### Proxy cache and tag freshness

- Digest references (`sha256:…`) are content-addressed: cached forever, never
  revalidated.
- Tag references on **proxied** images are revalidated against the upstream on
  every pull by default (`docker.metadata_ttl = -1`). A positive
  `metadata_ttl` (seconds) is the staleness bound: within the window the
  cached tag is served without an upstream round trip; after it, the next pull
  revalidates. `0` or negative always revalidates.
- If every configured upstream fails and `docker.serve_stale = true`
  (default), the last cached manifest is served with `x-nora-stale: true`.
- Locally **pushed** (hosted) images are authoritative: a pushed tag is served
  as-is and never revalidated against an upstream. Pushing to a name that
  would otherwise proxy pins that tag to the pushed copy — to keep a tag
  tracking the upstream, do not push to it.

### Known Limitations
- Max 2-level image path: `org/image:tag` works, `org/sub/path/image:tag` returns 404
- Large monolithic blob PUT (>~500MB) may fail even with high body limit
- No cross-repository blob mounting
- Registry-mirror caching depends on Docker's image store / distribution client, not the storage driver. Docker applies the wrong credentials to mirror endpoints — it sends the upstream registry's credentials to the mirror (and on the containerd path clobbers per-mirror `hosts.toml` credentials), so an authenticated mirror pull fails and Docker falls back to the upstream, skipping the cache. Both the legacy and containerd code paths are affected ([moby/moby#30880](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/30880), [#42022](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/42022); upstream fix in progress in [#52532](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/52532)). An unauthenticated mirror avoids it — set `[auth] docker_anon_pull = true` to serve pulls without a login while still requiring auth on push (this is the Docker-specific switch; the general `anonymous_read` does not open `/v2/`). For pull-through caching of non-Docker-Hub registries, the containerd image store additionally tags mirror requests with the `?ns=` upstream namespace ([containerd hosts.md](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/hosts.md)). (#578)

## Raw File Storage

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|

## RubyGems

Caching proxy for rubygems.org. Immutable gem/gemspec caching with TTL-based index refresh.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Compact index (`/info/{name}`) | Full | TTL-cached |
| Gem download (`/gems/{name}-{ver}.gem`) | Full | Immutable cache |
| Gemspec (`/quick/Marshal.4.8/...`) | Full | Immutable cache |
| Full index (`specs.4.8.gz`) | Full | TTL-cached |
| Latest index (`latest_specs.4.8.gz`) | Full | TTL-cached |
| Gem push | — | Proxy-only (read) |

Client: `bundle config mirror.https://rubygems.org http://nora:4000/gems/`

## Terraform

Caching proxy for registry.terraform.io. Provider binaries are immutably cached; metadata uses TTL.
NORA serves both Terraform protocols against the same upstream: the **Registry Protocol**
(origin-registry, service-discovery based) and the **Network Mirror Protocol** (what
`network_mirror` speaks).

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Service discovery (`.well-known/terraform.json`) | Full | Registry protocol; points to NORA |
| Provider versions list | Full | TTL-cached |
| Provider download metadata | Full | `download_url` rewritten to NORA |
| Provider binary download | Full | Immutable cache |
| Module versions list | Full | TTL-cached |
| Module download | Full | `X-Terraform-Get` header pass-through |
| **Network mirror — `index.json`** | Full | Mirror protocol; list versions (#801) |
| **Network mirror — `{version}.json`** | Full | Mirror protocol; archives via NORA + `zh:` hash (#801) |
| Provider publish | — | Proxy-only (read) |

Client (network mirror — Terraform requires an `https:` URL, trailing slash):
`provider_installation { network_mirror { url = "https://nora.example.com/terraform/" } }`

**Limitations (accepted):**
- **Single upstream** — the `{hostname}` in a mirror request is validated but not routed;
  only the configured `terraform.proxy` upstream's providers resolve.
- **Mirror-mode integrity is weaker than registry mode** — in `network_mirror` mode
  Terraform does not run the origin-registry GPG check, and NORA does not itself verify
  `SHA256SUMS.sig`. Archives carry `zh:<sha256>` from upstream metadata (fail-closed: a
  platform without a resolvable shasum is omitted). Upgrade path: verify `SHA256SUMS.sig`
  against a pinned HashiCorp key at ingest.

## Ansible Galaxy (v3 API)

Caching proxy for galaxy.ansible.com. Collection tarballs are immutably cached.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| API discovery | Full | `/ansible/` and `/ansible/api/` |
| Collection list | Full | Short v3 and Pulp-style paths |
| Collection detail | Full | URL rewriting |
| Collection versions | Full | Paginated |
| Version detail | Full | Curation checks |
| Tarball download | Full | Immutable cache, both `/download/` and `/artifacts/` paths |
| Tarball curation | Full | Blocklist/allowlist, integrity verification |
| Collection publish | — | Proxy-only (read) |

Namespace and collection name validation follows Galaxy spec (`[a-z0-9_]+`).

Client: `ansible-galaxy collection install ns.name -s http://nora:4000/ansible/`

## NuGet (v3 API)

Caching proxy for api.nuget.org. Service index URLs are rewritten to point through NORA.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Service index (`/v3/index.json`) | Full | `@id` URLs rewritten to NORA |
| Registration index | Full | TTL-cached |
| Version list (flat container) | Full | TTL-cached |
| `.nupkg` download | Full | Immutable cache |
| `.nuspec` download | Full | Immutable cache |
| Package push | — | Proxy-only (read) |
| Search | — | Not implemented |

Client: `dotnet nuget add source http://nora:4000/nuget/v3/index.json -n nora`

## Pub (Dart/Flutter)

Caching proxy for pub.dev. Package archives are immutably cached with SHA256 verification.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Package search (`/api/packages?q=`) | Full | Response URL rewriting |
| Package metadata (`/api/packages/{name}`) | Full | `archive_url` rewritten to NORA |
| Version metadata | Full | Cached |
| Security advisories | Full | Cached |
| Archive download (`.tar.gz`) | Full | Immutable cache, SHA256 verified |
| Package publish | — | Proxy-only (read) |

Client: `export PUB_HOSTED_URL=http://nora:4000/pub && dart pub get`

## Conan (C/C++)

Caching proxy for ConanCenter (center2.conan.io). Recipe and package files are immutably cached (scoped to revision hashes). Metadata uses TTL-based caching.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Ping (`/v2/ping`) | Full | Returns `X-Conan-Server-Capabilities: revisions` |
| Recipe search | Full | Proxied to upstream |
| Recipe latest revision | Full | TTL-cached |
| Recipe revision list | Full | TTL-cached |
| Recipe file list | Full | Immutable cache (revision-scoped) |
| Recipe file download | Full | Immutable cache |
| Package latest revision | Full | TTL-cached |
| Package revision list | Full | TTL-cached |
| Package file list | Full | Immutable cache (revision-scoped) |
| Package file download | Full | Immutable cache |
| Recipe/package upload | — | Proxy-only (read) |
| Authentication | — | Anonymous read only |

Client: `conan remote add nora http://nora:4000/conan`

## RPM (yum/dnf)

Hosted repositories with server-generated repodata (createrepo-style). Each
`/rpm/{repo}/` path is an independent repository; publishing or deleting a
package regenerates `repodata/` (repomd.xml + sha256-named
primary/filelists/other.xml.gz). Package headers are parsed server-side — no
`createrepo_c` needed on the client.

Pull-through proxy repositories: map a repo name to one upstream yum repo
(`[rpm.proxies] fedora = "https://…/Everything/x86_64/os"`). A proxied repo is
read-only (writes → 409); upstream metadata (repodata/, including the
upstream's signatures) is served verbatim within `rpm.metadata_ttl` seconds
(default 300), packages are cached forever, and a stale cache is served with
`x-nora-stale: true` when the upstream is down. `nora mirror rpm --repo
<name>` pre-fetches every package for fully offline (air-gapped) clients.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `repodata/repomd.xml` | Full | Regenerated on publish/delete, `Cache-Control: no-cache` |
| `primary.xml.gz` | Full | name/evr/arch, provides/requires/conflicts/obsoletes with flags, primary file subset, header-range |
| `filelists.xml.gz` | Full | All files with dir/ghost types |
| `other.xml.gz` | Full | Changelogs (last 10 per package, configurable) |
| Package publish (`PUT {repo}/{name}.rpm`) | Full | Header parsed and validated; invalid RPMs rejected |
| Package delete (`DELETE {repo}/{name}.rpm`) | Full | Repodata regenerated |
| Package download | Full | Byte-identical, sha256 pkgid in repodata |
| GPG-signed repodata (`repomd.xml.asc`) | Full | Signed on every regeneration; verify with `repo_gpgcheck=1`. Object-store backends (S3/GCS) require `signing.key_path` — without it signing is disabled with a startup warning |
| Public key (`repodata/repomd.xml.key`) | Full | Armored, for `gpgkey=`; key auto-generated at first boot |
| Package signatures (`gpgcheck=1`) | — | Packages are stored as uploaded; NORA signs metadata, not packages |
| Reconcile (`POST {repo}/-/reindex`) | Full | Heals out-of-band storage changes: drops orphan metadata, adopts added packages, rebuilds + re-signs repodata |
| Upstream proxy | Full | Per-repo pull-through via `[rpm.proxies]`; digest quarantine via `[curation.rpm]` |
| Offline mirror | Full | `nora mirror rpm --repo <name> [--arch x86_64,noarch]` warms the full package set |
| sqlite metadata (`*_db`) | — | XML metadata only (all modern dnf/yum versions) |
| Delta RPMs (`prestodelta`) | — | Not generated |
| Module metadata (`modules.yaml`) | — | Not generated |

Publish: `curl -u user:pass -T pkg.rpm http://nora:4000/rpm/myrepo/pkg.rpm`

Client `.repo` file:

```ini
[nora-myrepo]
name=NORA myrepo
baseurl=http://nora:4000/rpm/myrepo
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=http://nora:4000/rpm/myrepo/repodata/repomd.xml.key
```

`gpgcheck=0` stays: NORA signs the repository metadata, not the packages
themselves. With signing disabled (`signing.enabled = false`), also set
`repo_gpgcheck=0`.

## Debian (APT)

Hosted repositories with server-generated indexes, in either apt layout
(chosen per package at publish): *flat* (indexes at the repo root, sources
line `deb <url>/deb/{repo} ./`) or *structured* (`dists/{distribution}/`
suites with components, sources line `deb <url>/deb/{repo} jammy main`).
Each `/deb/{repo}/` path is an independent repository; publishing or
deleting a package regenerates every affected index. Package control
paragraphs are parsed server-side from the .deb
(ar → control.tar.{,gz,xz,zst}) — no `dpkg-scanpackages` needed.

Pull-through proxy repositories: map a repo name to one upstream apt repo
(`[deb.proxies] debian = "https://deb.debian.org/debian"`). A proxied repo is
read-only (writes → 409); upstream indexes (dists/, including the upstream's
InRelease/Release.gpg) are served verbatim within `deb.metadata_ttl` seconds
(default 300), packages are cached forever, and a stale cache is served with
`x-nora-stale: true` when the upstream is down. `nora mirror deb --repo
<name> --dist <dist>` pre-fetches every package for fully offline
(air-gapped) clients.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `Packages` / `Packages.gz` | Full | Verbatim control paragraphs + Filename/Size/MD5sum/SHA1/SHA256 |
| `Release` (flat repo) | Full | MD5Sum + SHA256 sections, `Cache-Control: no-cache` |
| `dists/` layout (suites/components) | Full | `PUT ...?distribution=<dist>[&component=<comp>]`; per-dist Release + `{component}/binary-{arch}/Packages{,.gz}`; arch-`all` packages folded into every concrete arch index; upload path is free-form (`Filename` is repo-root-relative, `pool/` not required) |
| Package publish (`PUT {repo}/{name}.deb`) | Full | Control parsed and validated; invalid debs rejected; decompression bombs bounded |
| Package delete (`DELETE {repo}/{name}.deb`) | Full | Indexes regenerated; emptied distributions are removed |
| Package download | Full | Byte-identical |
| `InRelease` (clearsigned) / `Release.gpg` (detached) | Full | Signed on every regeneration (per distribution in the structured layout); verify via `signed-by` |
| Public key (`pubkey.gpg`) | Full | Armored, for the `signed-by` keyring; key auto-generated at first boot |
| Reconcile (`POST {repo}/-/reindex`) | Full | Heals out-of-band storage changes: drops orphan metadata, adopts added packages (into the flat layout — placement is upload-time intent), rebuilds + re-signs indexes |
| by-hash | — | Not generated; index files are served `Cache-Control: no-cache` |
| Translations / Contents indexes | — | Not generated (proxied repos pass them through) |
| Upstream proxy | Full | Per-repo pull-through via `[deb.proxies]`; digest quarantine via `[curation.deb]` |
| Offline mirror | Full | `nora mirror deb --repo <name> [--dist <dist>] [--component main] [--arch amd64]` warms the full package set |

Publish (flat): `curl -u user:pass -T pkg.deb http://nora:4000/deb/myrepo/pkg.deb`

Publish (structured):
`curl -u user:pass -T pkg.deb "http://nora:4000/deb/myrepo/pool/pkg.deb?distribution=jammy&component=main"`

Client setup:

```
curl -fsSL http://nora:4000/deb/myrepo/pubkey.gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/nora.asc
# flat
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/nora.asc] http://nora:4000/deb/myrepo ./" \
  > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nora.list
# structured
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/nora.asc] http://nora:4000/deb/myrepo jammy main" \
  > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nora.list
```

With signing disabled (`signing.enabled = false`), use `[trusted=yes]`
instead of `[signed-by=...]`.

## CPAN

Caching proxy for www.cpan.org. Distribution tarballs are immutably cached;
the package index uses TTL-based caching.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Package index (`02packages.details.txt.gz`) | Full | TTL-cached |
| Module list (`03modlist.data.gz`) | Full | TTL-cached |
| Author directory (`01mailrc.txt.gz`) | Full | TTL-cached |
| Distribution download (`authors/id/*`) | Full | Immutable cache |
| Distribution publish | — | Proxy-only (read) |

The web UI groups cached releases by parsing archive filenames with a local
adaptation of `CPAN::DistnameInfo`. It supports modern `Dist-1.23` names and
legacy underscore, dot, and directly-attached version forms. `.meta` and
`.readme` sidecars are not fetched or parsed for grouping. Consequently, the
distribution page lists versions already cached by NORA; unparseable archive
names are omitted from the grouped author view. The exact rules and examples
are documented in [the CPAN proxy design](docs/design/2026-09-18-cpan-proxy-design.md#distribution-grouping-in-the-ui).

Client:
```bash
cpanm --from http://nora:4000/cpan Module::Name
```

## Helm OCI

Helm charts are stored as OCI artifacts via the Docker registry endpoints. `helm push` and `helm pull` work through the standard `/v2/` API.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `helm push` (OCI) | Full | Via Docker PUT manifest/blob |
| `helm pull` (OCI) | Full | Via Docker GET manifest/blob |
| Helm repo index (`index.yaml`) | — | Not implemented (OCI only) |

## Cross-Cutting Features

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Authentication (Bearer/Basic) | Full | Per-request token validation; see OIDC note below |
| Anonymous read | Full | `NORA_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_READ=true` |
| Rate limiting (429 + Retry-After) | Full | `tower_governor`, per-IP, documented in OpenAPI |
| 405 Method Not Allowed + Allow | Full | RFC 9110 §15.5.6, multi-method routes return Allow header |
| Prometheus metrics | Full | `/metrics` endpoint |
| Health check | Full | `/health` |
| Swagger/OpenAPI | Full | `/api-docs` |
| S3 backend | Full | AWS S3, Ceph RGW. Basic storage works on any S3-compatible; multi-replica write-serialization has a caveat — see note below. |
| GCS backend | Full | Native Google Cloud Storage (`storage.mode = "gcs"`): Workload Identity / service-account JSON / ambient credentials; endpoint override for emulators and Private Google Access. Same single-writer caveat as S3 for rpm/deb publishing (in-process publish lock). Hash-pinning (at-rest integrity verification) works on every backend: the pin is the `sha256` object metadata on S3/GCS. |
| Local filesystem backend | Full | Default, content-addressable |
| Activity log | Full | Recent push/pull in dashboard |
| Backup/restore | Full | CLI commands |
| Mirror CLI | Full | `nora mirror` for npm/pip/cargo/maven/docker/rpm/deb |

### OIDC authentication transport

OIDC JWT tokens are validated only on the **Bearer** authentication path.
Docker, twine, and Maven clients transmit credentials via HTTP Basic, and the
Basic-auth handler recognises htpasswd passwords and opaque API tokens (`nra_…`)
but does **not** attempt OIDC JWT validation on the password field. To use OIDC
workload identity from CI, send the JWT as a `Bearer` token (e.g.
`Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`) rather than as a `docker login` password. For
`docker login` specifically, use an opaque API token created via the UI or
`/api/tokens`. (#853)

### Storage backend notes

- **Multi-replica write-serialization needs conditional-write/CAS.** NORA's write lock
  (`publish_lock`) is safe under a **single writer** — one replica, or an RWO volume
  single-mounted so only one pod writes. Serializing concurrent writes across multiple
  replicas requires an object store with atomic conditional-write / compare-and-swap:
  AWS S3 and Ceph RGW provide it; **Garage** (no consensus layer) and **SeaweedFS**
  (immature) do not — on those, run single-writer. Not every "S3-compatible" backend is
  equivalent here.
