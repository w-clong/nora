//! Compile-time integrity witnesses for stored artifacts (typestate).
//!
//! NORA already enforces its integrity guarantees at runtime: the buffered
//! [`Storage::get`](crate::storage::Storage::get) gate hash-pin-verifies bytes
//! before returning them (`#582`/`#604`), the streaming docker path
//! tamper-detects at EOF, and `put` couples the body write with a hash-pin
//! record on every backend. This module pushes those guarantees one step
//! **left** — into the type system — and, just as importantly, makes the
//! *known holes* impossible to hide.
//!
//! # The honest tiers (grounded in live code)
//!
//! A served-bytes value carries a zero-sized [`Integrity`] witness `S`:
//!
//! - [`Verified`] — the bytes were SHA-256-checked against an expected digest
//!   and **matched**. This is *sound by construction*: the only constructor,
//!   [`Blob::<Verified>::verify`], performs the hash itself, so possessing a
//!   `Blob<Verified>` is a proof that `sha256(bytes) == expected`. No `unsafe`,
//!   no privileged constructor, no cross-crate seal to trust. What `expected`
//!   *means* is the caller's to state: for a hash-pinned cache read it is the
//!   digest NORA recorded at store time (tamper-evidence against on-disk
//!   corruption — `src/storage/mod.rs`), and for a content-addressed
//!   artifact (a docker blob, whose key *is* its digest) it is the canonical
//!   upstream digest.
//!
//! - [`TamperEvident`] — streamed bytes whose digest is verified only at EOF
//!   (`src/registry/docker.rs`, `VerifyingReader`). A mismatch aborts the
//!   response, but bytes already streamed cannot be un-sent. Strictly weaker
//!   than [`Verified`]; named so it can never be silently treated as the strong
//!   tier.
//!
//! - [`Unverified`] — raw bytes with no NORA-side integrity guarantee: a
//!   streaming `get_reader`/`get_range` read, an in-memory buffer, or
//!   proxy-upstream bytes that were never NORA-stored.
//!
//! # Why this is push-left, not theatre
//!
//! A serve sink that demands `Blob<Verified>` (see [`verified_body`]) *cannot*
//! be handed raw or merely-tamper-evident bytes — that is a compile error, not
//! a runtime check that a future refactor might skip. And the open-world hole
//! (an object stored with no pin) is forced into the open by [`GateOutcome`]:
//! a caller of
//! [`Storage::get_verified`](crate::storage::Storage::get_verified) must
//! `match` and decide what to do with [`GateOutcome::Unpinned`] — it can never
//! be mistaken for a cryptographically verified read.
//!
//! Compile-fail proofs live in `tests/typestate_compile_fail.rs` (trybuild);
//! the positive direction is unit-tested below.
