# Detects read-modify-write patterns without proper lock scope

# 1. update/generate metadata functions that write storage without lock
# 2. publish_lock guard inside if-block (drops before storage.put)
# 3. Known RMW patterns: index append, metadata merge

# The awk programs below stay within POSIX awk. They used to rely on gawk's
# three-argument `match()`, which mawk — the default `awk` on Debian, Ubuntu and the CI
# images — rejects; an aborted awk prints nothing, and "no output" reads exactly like
# "no findings", so the check would have passed vacuously wherever gawk was absent.
# Verified against both gawk and mawk by scripts/test-lock-audit.sh.

# ── Check 2: lock guard must not be scoped inside a conditional/loop block ──
# Bad pattern: publish_lock + _guard inside `if cond { … }` (or for/while/loop),
# whose closing brace drops the guard BEFORE a later storage.put = unprotected write.
#
# A write on a branch that is MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE with the guarded one is not that
# pattern: the guard is never taken on the path that reaches the write, so it cannot
# have dropped before it. The forward scan therefore skips a write whose enclosing
# `if` chain contains the textual negation of a condition enclosing the guard
# (`if !is_tarball` guard vs `if is_tarball` write). Without this the check reports
# any write placed later in the same function after an unrelated guarded block.
#
# Where the reasoning is beyond textual analysis, a `// LOCK-SAFE: <reason>` comment
# inside the write's own block exempts it — with the reason recorded next to the code.
# The marker must carry text; a bare `// LOCK-SAFE:` does not silence anything. Only a
# marker local to the write counts: the function-level markers this repo already carries
# (#518/#520) are deliberately NOT honoured, because a function-wide exemption would
# have hidden the genuine finding in the same handler (#975).
#
# The guard's *enclosing* block is found by a backward brace-walk from the guard
# line (the first unmatched `{` going up). We flag ONLY when that opener is an
# if/else/for/while/loop. A guard at function-body scope after early-return guard
# clauses (`if validate(..).is_err() { return }`) has the fn body as its encloser
# and is correctly NOT flagged — the previous line-window heuristic false-positived
# on exactly that idiom (deb/rpm delete_package).
